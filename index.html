        <h2>Objective:</h2>
        <p>
          The objective of this project was to gain experience building web apps
          in React with an aggregator function. I created a sandwitch builder
          app that lets you add ingrediants and create your own sandwitch. The app
          comes with sort and filter features to sort/filter though items (nut
          butters, jams, toppings).
        </p>

        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          First, we want to research other websites with aggregator functions. I
          chose 3 websites with a favoriting function. I chose to compare Etsy,
          Sephora, and Amazon's favoriting functionality and to outline the
          differences in a comparison chart.
        </p>
        <p>Etsy: <a href="https://www.etsy.com/">https://www.etsy.com/</a>
        <br />Sephora: <a href="https://www.sephora.com/">https://www.sephora.com/</a>
        <br />Amazon: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">https://www.amazon.com/</a> </p>
        <h3>Comparison Chart</h3>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          <span class="color">Etsy's Favorites List:</span> Etsy’s favorite list
          is the most basic. You can only click into the items from the favorites list and
          there is no one-click button to add the item to the cart. This leads
          to less users actually buying the item from the favorites list,
          because there is no visual incentive. You can search through items, but, in
          comparison, an add to cart button would have been more helpful than
          the search.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="color">Sephora Loves List:</span> Sephora’s “loves” list
          is more catered for users. Unlike Etsy, they have an easy “Add to
          Basket” button. This makes it easy for users to buy the item from the
          liked list. Though the Sephora list doesn’t show the date added, you
          can filter by recently added. The filter is a trade-off from the
          search in Etsy and Amazon, where both could be used to find a specific
          item.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="color">Amazon Shopping List:</span> Amazon’s shopping
          lists have the most detailed functionality. There are multiple shopping
          lists you can add, and you can name the lists. This is a good
          idea, because it allows users to navigate to self-categorized
          liked products (e.i. makeup, fashion, home goods). Also, Amazon has an
          immediate undo option after you click remove, which is more convenient
          than a second confirmation click to remove like Etsy, which requires
          extra work.
        </p>
        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
        <p>
          For my aggregator website, I want to implement similar features from
          the websites researched:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Sort items by price (high to low, low to high) and by name (A to Z,
            Z to A) like Sephora
          </li>
          <li>
            One-click remove like Amazon and Sephora which makes it convenient to delete an item
          </li>
          <li>
            Option to remove items from the aggregated list all at once like
            Amazon
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Designing My Own React App</h2>
        <h3>Theme</h3>
        <p>
          I decided to create a sandwitch builder app called PB&J Time that
          allows you to build gourmet peanut butter and jelly sandwitches. The
          aggregator function would be adding to the cart/adding to the
          sandwitch. I want to show the sandwitch "build" on the screen and include
          sort/filtering functionality.
        </p>
        <h3>Visual Design</h3>
        <p>Initial sketch of web app:</p>
        <div class="sketch">
          <img src="public/pbj-time.jpg" alt="Sketch of PB&J Time Web App" />
        </div>
        <p>
          Instead of making a Figma mockup of my web app, I decided to base my
          webpage design off an existing React app I've worked on: Blueno's
          Bakery!
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot">
          <img
            src="public/blueno-bakery.png"
            alt="Screenshot of Blueno's Bakery React App based visual design off of"
          />
        </div>

        <h2>Creating My React App</h2>
        <h3>Production</h3>
        <p>
          I then got to coding. I created my React app and deployed it with the
          help of Vercel. <br />Link to app:
          <a href="https://sandwitch-builder.vercel.app/"
            >https://sandwitch-builder.vercel.app</a
          >
        </p>

          <img
            src="public/app.png"
            alt="Screenshot of PB&J Time React App in deployed form"
          />
        </div>
        <p>Check out a video of me navigating through the app!</p>

        <h3>List of Future Features</h3>
        <p>One shortcoming of the app is that there is no way for users
           to mark when they're done building their sandwitch. So, potential features to add could be:</p>
        <ul class="features">
          <li>
            <span class="color">Build Button:</span> button to click when done building sandwitch, plays confetti effect then clears sandwitch 
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="color">Popup:</span> popup appearing after press "Build" button, shows celebratory message and final image of sandwitch
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Now it's your turn! Navigate to <a href="https://sandwitch-builder.vercel.app/"
          >https://sandwitch-builder.vercel.app</a
