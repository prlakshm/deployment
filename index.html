        <h2>Objective:</h2>
        <p>
          The objective of the responsive redesign project was to improve the
          usability of the Ky Michaels Salon home page through responsive web
          design techniques.
        </p>

        <h2>Webpage:</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://kymichaelssalon.com/"
            >https://kymichaelssalon.com/</a

        <p>
          Ky Michaels Salon is a small business on Wickenden Street in
          Providence. Their home page is the first page you see when you click
          on their website. It lists the salon’s hours, address, and other
          important information about the salon.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ky Michaels Salon is the salon I go to in Providence to cut my hair,
          but I usually call in because their website is hard to navigate and
          there is no link to book an appointment. I chose to redesign the home
          page to help make the website interaction easier.
        </p>

        <h2>Usability Issues:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Embedded YouTube video first thing on home page. Takes up most of
            page. so inefficient and have to scroll to access main information.
          </li>
          <li>
            Title on the browser tab is “Best Salon in Rhode Island color
            specialists precision cutting,” and not salon name. Makes tab harder
            to navigate to.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <img src="public/tab_bar.png" alt="Ky Michaels Salon Tab Title" />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Booking an appointment and pricing information are hard to find.
            Have to use dropdown menu.
          </li>
          <li>
            Inconsistent drop-down menus in the header. Some have drop-down menu
            options and other do not. No indication which ones do.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lack of a "Shop" option and unclear product categorization. Products
            categorized by brand name (e.i. “R+CO,” “Shu Uemura,” “Kerastase,”
            “Oribe”), and don't immediately know they're names of hair brands.
          </li>
          <li>
            Home page only includes hours and address. Some stylists only work
            certain days, so misleading.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="screenshot">
          <img
            src="public/home_page2.png"
            alt="Ky Michaels Salon Home Page Scoll to Page 2"
          />
        </div>

        <h2>Accessibility Issues:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Webpage is not well-adapted for screen readers. Not all body text is
            read and cannot navigate through text using arrow keys .
          </li>
          <li>Missing alternative text for images.</li>
          <li>Low contrast icons in the footer of payment options accept.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="screenshot">

        </div>
        <p>We can do better! Let's improve this webpage some more.</p>

        <h2>Speed Sketching</h2>
        <p>
          I used speed sketching to think of new designs for my webpage. This
          technique helps flush out ideas!

        <h2>Final Sketch</h2>
        <p>
          Here is a final sketch of my design for the Ky Michaels Salon home
          page.

        <h2>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        <p>
          Low-fidelity wireframes are basic representations of a digital
          interface. They map out general layout of sections/objects. I created
          low-fidelity wireframes at the beginning of my design process using
          Figma.

        <h3>Tablet</h3>

        <h2>Visual Design Style Guide</h2>
        <p>
          My style guide details the <span class="italic">"look"</span> of my
          webpage.

        />

        <h2>High Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        <p>
          High-fidelity wireframes are representations of the polished, final
          design. They employ components of the visual style guide, like fonts,
          colors, buttons, and input boxes. I created my high-fidelity
          wireframes using Figma.
