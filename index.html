        <h2>Objective:</h2>
        <p>
          The objective of this project was to gain experience building web apps
          in React with an aggregator function. I created a sandwitch builder
          app that lets you add ingrediants and make your own sandwitch. The app
          comes with sort and filter features to sort/filter though items (nut
          butters, jams, toppings).
        </p>

        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          First, we want to research other websites with aggregator functions. I
          chose 3 websites with a favoriting function. I chose to compare Etsy,
          Sephora, and Amazon's favoriting functionality and to outline the
          differences in a comparison chart.
        </p>
        <h3>Comparison Chart</h3>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          <span class="color">Etsy's Favorites List:</span> Etsy’s favorite list
          is the most basic. You can only click into the items from the list and
          there is no one-click button to add the item to the cart. This leads
          to less users actually buying the item from the favorites list,
          because there is no incentive. You can search through items, but, in
          comparison, an add to cart button would have been more helpful than
          the search.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="color">Sephora Loves List:</span> Sephora’s “loves” list
          is more catered for users. Unlike Etsy, they have an easy “Add to
          Basket” button. This makes it easy for users to buy the item from the
          liked list. Though the Sephora list doesn’t show the date added, you
          can filter by recently added. The filter is a trade-off from the
          search in Etsy and Amazon, where both could be used to find a specific
          item.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="color">Amazon Shopping List:</span> Amazon’s shopping
          lists had the most detailed functionality. There are multiple shopping
          lists you can add, and you can name the shopping lists. This is a good
          idea, because it allows users to easily navigate to self-categorized
          liked products (e.i. makeup, fashion, home goods). Also, Amazon has an
          immediate undo option after you click remove, which is more convenient
          than a second confirmation click to remove like Etsy, which requires
          extra work.
        </p>
        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
        <p>
          For my aggregator website, I want to implement similar features from
          the websites researched:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Sort items by price (high to low, low to high) and by name (A to Z,
            Z to A) like Sephora
          </li>
          <li>
            Option to remove items from the aggregated list all at once like
            Amazon
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Creating My Own React App</h2>
        <h3>Theme</h3>
        <p>
          I decided to create a sandwitch builder app called PB&J Time
          that allows you to build gourmet peanut butter and jelly sandwitches.
          The aggregator function would be adding to the cart/adding to the
          sandwitch. I want the sandwitch to "build" on the screen and include
          sort/filtering funcitonality.
        </p>
        <h3>Visual Design</h3>
        <p>Initial sketch of web app:</p>
        <div class="sketch">
        <img src="public/pbj-time.jpg" alt="Sketch of PB&J Time Web App" />
        </div>
        <p>Instead of making a Figma mockup of my web app, I decided to base my webpage design off an existing 
          React app I've worked on: Blueno's Bakery!
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot">
          <img src="public/blueno-bakery.png" alt="Sketch of PB&J Time Web App" />
          </div>
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Sorting feature: can sort by category of item (nut butter, jam, topping) and by flavor (savory, sweet)</li>
          <li>Filtering Categories: can filter by price (high to low, low to high) and name (A to Z, Z to A)</li> 
          <li>Stackable Sort and Filter: sort and filter can be layered, existing sort applied when filter changes and vice versa</li>  
          <li>Instructions: sort intructions on how to use sandwitch builder app</li> 
          <li>Aggregator Section: cart with items on right, items also added to sandwitch visual</li> 
          <li>Updated count of items in your aggregator: count of items in cart and total price displayed at bottom cart</li>
          <li>Reset functionality: can reset sort and reset filter with dropdown menu </li>
          <li>16 Item Cards Each Displaying: item image, item name, item category, item flavor, item price</li>
          <li>Button Adds and Removes from Aggregator: button to add to cart from item card, "X" to remove from cart</li>
          <li>Clear Cart: trash can button to remove all items from cart</li>
          <li>AI-generated Images: all images  enerated with Prodia AI and edited with Photoshop to match asthetic</li>
          <li>Animation: items "laid" down with animation onto sandwitch visual</li>
        </ul>
