        <h2>Objective:</h2>
        <p>
          The objective of this project was to gain experience building web apps
          in React with an aggregator function. I created a sandwitch builder app that lets you
          add ingrediants and make your own sandwitch. The app comes with sort
          and filter features to sort/filter though items (nut butters, jams,
          toppings).
        </p>

        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          First, we want to research other websites with aggregator functions. I chose 
          3 websites with a favoriting function. I chose to compare Etsy, Sephora, and Amazon's favoriting
          functionality and to outline the differences in a comparison chart. 
        </p>
        <h3>Metrics</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="color">Time on Page </span>: Time spent on page to
            complete the task.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="color">Number of Clicks </span>: Number of clicks on
            the page.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="color">If Misclicked </span>: A boolean representing if
            a user clicked a button not relevant to the task.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Webpage Version A</h2>
        <p>
          I tested on a doctor's office webpage. We are trying to design this
          webpage to make it easy to book an appointment.
        </p>
        <video width="780" controls>
          <source src="public/Version_A.mp4" type="video/mp4" />

        </video>
        <div class="screenshot">
          <img
            src="public/a_html.png"
            alt="Original Version A of Doctor's Office Webpage"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          The original version of the webpage has some usability issues: the
          <span class="color">light blue buttons were hard to see</span> and the
          <span class="color"
            >appointment rows were not ordered chronologically</span
          >. Both these issues could make it difficult for the user to book an
          appointment.
        </p>

        <h2>Webpage Version B</h2>
        <video width="780" controls>
          <source src="public/Version_B.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
          Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
        <img
          src="public/Version_B_diagram.png"
          alt="Version B of Doctor's Office Webpage"
        />
        <p>
          This version fixes some of the usability issues and makes other small
          changes to the webpage. But is it "better?" Let's find out!
        </p>

        <h2>Statistical Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          All participants were asked to schedule an appointment with Adam Ng,
          MD at Morristown Medical Center on April 23, 2024 as their task. For
          all tests, I used an alpha value of 0.05. So, a test is statistically
          significant if the p-value is less than the alpha.
        </p>
        <h3>Time on Page One Tailed T-Test</h3>
        <div class="stat-test">
          <p>
            Time on page is a continous variable (meaning the time spent can
            extend until infinity), so I knew to use a T-test. I chose to test
            this metric using a one-tailed T-test, because I wanted to see if
            version B optimized the time it took to complete the task on the
            webpage. I hoped that version B would make it easier for users to
            book an appointment, so time spent on version B would be less than
            time spent on version A.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="color">Null Hypothesis</span>: There is no difference
            in the time it takes to complete the task for version A and version
            B or version A takes less time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="color">Alternative Hypothesis</span>: Version B takes
            less time to complete the task.
          </p>
          <img
            src="public/time_on_page_graph.png"
            alt="Data and Statistical Variables from Time on Page T-Test"
          />
          <p>
            <span class="color">Conclusion</span>: The p-value is the level of
            significance. The p-value for this test was less than 0.01, which is
            smaller than the alpha. So, we accept the alternative hypothesis.
            The t-score is the magnitude of difference between the two groups.
            We received a negative t-score, meaning there was a significant
            decrease in time spent on the page from version A to version B. We
            are 95% confident that it takes users less time on version B to book
            an appointment.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="color">Summary Statistics</span>: The average time it
            took to complete the task in version A was 24.4 seconds, but in
            version B it was 9.4 seconds. This gives us a rough estimate of how
            much less time to takes on version B than on version A. There is at
            least a 10 second decrease in time it takes to book an appointment
            on version B than version A.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Number of Clicks One Tailed T-Test</h3>
        <div class="stat-test">
          <p>
            Number of clicks is a continous variable (the number of times a user
            clicks on the webpage can extend until infinity), so I knew to use a
            T-test. I used a one-tailed T-test, because I wanted to see if
            version B optimized the number of clicks it took to complete the
            task. I hoped that version B would make it easier for users to book
            an appointment, so there would be fewer clicks on version B than on
            version A. For both versions, there required 2 correct clicks to
            complete the task.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="color">Null Hypothesis</span>: There is no difference
            in the number of clicks it takes to complete the task for version A
            and version B or version A uses less clicks.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="color">Alternative Hypothesis</span>: Version B uses
            less clicks to complete the task than version A.
          </p>
          <img
            src="public/num_clicks_graph.png"
            alt="Data and Statistical Variables from Time on Page T-Test"
          />
          <p>
            <span class="color">Conclusion</span>: The p-value for this test was
            0.01, which is less than the alpha. We accept the alternative
            hypothesis. The t-score is negative, so there was a significant
            decrease in the number of clicks on the page from version A to
            version B. We are 95% confident that it takes users less clicks on
            version B to book an appointment than on version A.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="color">Summary Statistics</span>: The average clicks it
            took to complete the task in version A was 5, but in version B it
            was 2.5 clicks. The task only takes 2 clicks to complete, so version
            A led to more misclicks. We can conclude that version B makes it
            more straightforward to book an appointment and that version A can
            be misleading. Version A also has a variance of 28.9, whereas
            version B has a variance of 0.2. This means there is more change in
            the number of clicks used in version A than B. So, users are more
            certain in version B on where to click when booking an appointment.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>If Misclicked Chi-Square Test</h3>
        <div class="stat-test">
          <p>
            If misclicked is a categorical variable, meaning each group can have
            2 categories, TRUE or FALSE for if the user misclicked. We are tring
            to see if the frequency of each category is different across the two
            versions, so we use a chi-square test. I wanted to see if there was
            a difference on if the user misclicked in version A and version B. I
            hoped version B would lead to less misclicks.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="color">Null Hypothesis</span>: There is no difference
            on if the user misclicked for version A and version B.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="color">Alternative Hypothesis</span>: There is a
            difference on if the user misclicked for version A and version B.
          </p>
          <img
            src="public/if_misclicked_graph.png"
            alt="Data and Statistical Variables from Time on Page T-Test"
          />
          <p>
            <span class="color">Conclusion</span>: The p-value for this test was
            0.04, which is still less than the alpha. We accept the alternative
            hypothesis, and we are 95% confident that there is a difference on
            if the user misclicks across version A and version B.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="color">Summary Statistics</span>: We can look closer at
            the table values to find the direction of this difference. In
            version A there were 6 misclicks, but only 1 misclick in version B.
            This means that version B led to users being more confident in where
            to click to book an apointment than version A. So, version B is more
            user-friendly.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Combined Discussion</h2>
        <p>
          For all metrics, version B performed better. We can go ahead and
          change our doctor's office webpage from version A to version B to make
          it easier for the user to book an appointment. This update will
          improve user satisfaction and engagement, meaning that users are more
          likely to choose our website for service.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's also important to note that there were only 22 participlants in
          the testing process, where each test had 22 data points for version A
          and 21 data points for version B. All participants were college
          students. They were familiar with technology, so this could have led
          to bias in results. Though this testing process helped understand the
          significance of A/B testing, if we were testing a real webpage, we
          would need to test according to that website's demographic and traffic
          rate.
